# Foundation and Objectives

Founded by the Digirazed, the Greggers' Guild has the objective to push the engineering and applied magic to their limits. They are the responsible for the most beautiful architectonical and enginnering wonders of the world, like the Bridge of Inertia.

# Internal Structure

The Greggers use a system made of "Round Tables", each made of either engineering or applied magic. Each table has every rank in it, Masters, Apprentices and such. The decisions are taken collectively and anyone's opinion matter.


# Phylosophy

"To the infinity, and beyond", as they reflect upon their infinite research of innovation and will to go beyond the laws of magical and physical.

# Rivals and Allies

They are in good terms with Craggers, who usually give detailed schemes for new tools. However, they don't go too well with the Miggers, as these believe that practical magic and engineering go against what Botania and Mystical Agriculture is.
Furthermore they believe the Gazers to be too mystical and not very grounded on reality.

# Prerequisite To Enter

There are theorical exams and creative ones, where one must prove that they know the engineering process.

# Facts

- Greggers are known for their ability to create tools that use both engineering and magical principles
- It is said that the Guild has a collection of secret plans and projects that might be too dangerous and unstable for the world.
