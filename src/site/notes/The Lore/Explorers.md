# Foundation and Objectives

Founded by the Milinels, the Explorer's Guild has the objective to explore and map the whole world, in particular the unseen and unmapped ones. The mission is to know about the lands, to find out new resources and document new populations and creatures.


# Internal Structure

The guild is guided by a Captain Council, each captain has a particular region and continent. Under them, various tiers of explorer can be found:

- Novice
- Experienced
- Knowledged
- Expert
- Captain


# Phylosophy

The phylosophy of the guild is mostly "To Know and To Respect". It means that it's not the mindless seek of knowledge that guides the guild, but rather a methodological one, that wishes to integrate rather than segregate, and to respect any new discovery.


# Rivals and Allies

Furthermore, Explorers tend to get attacked alongside the [[Sires\|Sires]] by the [[Fuuder\|Fuuder]]s.
