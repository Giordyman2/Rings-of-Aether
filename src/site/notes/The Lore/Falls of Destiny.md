This mystical place is what defines the border of the world, of the reality most live.

Water comes here from the rest of the world, and falls down to the border. However, for some reason, this has never made the world run out of sea water.

# Background

The Falls of Destiny were found first by Captain Elara the Bold, a [[Milinel\|Milinel]] that prior to this event was considered a [[Fuuder\|Fuuder]], that was intrigued by the strange mist that could be seen the north-west tip of the continent and decided to check it out.

She and her crew survived y not falling, because her ship was magically spit out of the border. And during this event, a comet appeared shortly in the night sky.

This news, with the new discovery brought by Elara, was seen as a good omen for Cascada, and brought a new Golden Age to it.

From that moment on, the falls were explored by several people, most of which never returned back, thus the name Falls of Destiny.


# Properties

The Falls of Destiny were watched and studied properly, by observing both the mist, which seems to have some kind of random magical effects, some of which can be curative. 

This is also why a Temple near the north-west tip, where the mist can be seen clearly, has been built, where clerics interpret the "messages" of the mist and the water. Many people come here to meditate and to pray, or to sail ship. This is because many Fuuders believe that swimming in some points will make a real Fuuder out of you.


During the Equinox and the Solstice, the forces of the water become particularly strong, making the area even more dangerous. During this period, usually there are held various cerimonies and festivals in all of Cascada.

The fishes and marine creatures have developed a sense of dangers that keep them out of the falls' range, while birds use them as a way to fly higher, as long as they don't cross the Border.

The Border is the line that once crossed, no matter how high you are, you will fall down to the pits of the Falls. Due to limitations, this phenomen has never been studied properly.

Every ten years or so, it is said that a giant whale appears near the mist, making various sounds, that clerics tend to interpret during their cerimonies.


# Legends, Myths and Theories

It is said that some nights you can hear melodies come from the Falls. It is believed that some might be lost souls of the fell people, other believe it to be beautiful women that sing from right at the border, though nobody has ever seen them.

Many [[Explorers\|Explorers]] have tried to see if there is a secret to the Falls. Thus, the legend of the Hidden Cave was born, a cave that supposedly is connected to other worlds and dimensions. However nobody has ever lived to tell the tale.


Since the water level on the world never is actually lost to the falls, it is said that there is a "well" that makes the water come back to the world. While it has not been ever seen, it's a sacred symbol and it is often shown in the Temples of Cascada.

Another theory is that water is collected by other entities or magic forces and it comes back through raining and clouds to the world.
