# Foundation and Objectives 

Founded by the Digirazed, the Miggers' Guild is deeply rooted in the traditions of agriculture, but with a mystical twist. They aim to harness both natural and magical means to cultivate the lands, develop sustainable farming methods, and explore the boundaries of Botania and Mystical Agriculture. 

To remember, the Botania is a specific way of nurturing magical power from plants and to transfer them to harvested crops, whereas Mystical Agriculture is the cousin to the alchemy, where the seed is imbued with magical power.


# Internal Structure

There is no hierarchy, as the guild shares the harvest and the money in case of bad years. All of the people in the guild are equal to each other.


# Phylosophy

"From the Earth, to the Earth; with a touch of Magic". The belief of sustainable farming and giving back to the land, while also exploring the use of magical means to enhance crop yields.

# Rivals and Allies

The Miggers are very friendly towards the Craggers and the Greggers, as they find new ways and tools to farm, while they are scared of Explorers as they might bring destruction onto their farmlands, even by accident.

# Prerequisites to Enter

To do so, one must pass the Vow of the Seeder, a magical rite that imbues one's very soul into the ground for 2 days, before sprouting and coming back to the original body. This ritual is very important, as it symbolyzes rebirth. It's rather important that few already experienced Miggers stand by the side of the new ones, to make them eat and drink.

# Facts

- The guild is responsible for some of the most amazing agricultural wonders, including ever-bearing fruit trees and small floating farmlands.
- Many Miggers are also skilled alchemists, using their crops for potion making.
