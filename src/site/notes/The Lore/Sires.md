# Foundation and Objectives 

Founded by the Munnens, the Sires' Guild aims to dominate the world of trade and commerce. The Sires believe in the power of the deal, aiming to create trade routes, establish marketplaces, and negotiate treaties that benefit not only themselves but also the communities they serve.

# Internal Structure

The guild is overseen by a Board of Merchants, made up of the most successful and influential traders. Below them are various ranks:

- Apprentice Trader
- Journeyman Trader
- Master Trader
- Elite Trader
- Board Member

While the Board of Merchants doesn't meet regularly, when they do, they decide the prices of the trades that cannot be lowered as long as you are in the Guild.

# Phylosophy


'Money talks, but a good deal sings.' This is the guild's motto, emphasizing that while money is important, a good deal that benefits all parties is the ultimate goal.


# Rivals and Allies

Sires are generally in good terms with the Spreekters, who help them in negotiations. They view the Explorers as useful for discovering new trade routes, but have a complicated relationship with the Defendium, as their protective actions sometimes disrupt trade. They are also usual targets of Fuuders. The Miggers believe that they are mostly greedy.


# Prerequisites to Enter

 A potential guild member must prove their business acumen through a series of tests, including negotiation challenges and business strategy exams.


# Facts

- Sires are known for their extravagant lifestyles, often flaunting their wealth as a testament of their success.
- The guild mantains an exclusive marketplace where only the most elite traders are allowed.
