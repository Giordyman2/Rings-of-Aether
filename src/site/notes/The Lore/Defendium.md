# Foundation and Objectives

Founded by the Lofanians, the guild has a very strong sense of honor and duty, as their principal objective is to defend the cities from monsters.

Recently, thanks to the requests of the [[The Lore/Sires\|Sires]], new subgroups that are specialized in protecting commercial routes and from specific magical threats have been created.

# Internal Structure

Much like the Explorer's one, there's a Commander's Council, where each Commander is the highest rank of the guild from each region.

There are various ranks here as well:
- Novice Defender
- Experienced Defender
- Expert Defender
- Elit√© Defender
- Commander

Each rank must follow the orders of the higher one in their presence or after their direct order.

# Phylosophy

The phylosophy is "Peace before everything". This has lead to some difficult choices, like sacrificing companions to close the gates in front of them to save the cities.

They have a very rigid and strict moral that punishes any kind of harm to anyone that doesn't pose a threat to peace.

# Rivals and Allies

To those who share the common grounds, they are allies. However, they do not see of good eye:

- The Explorers, as they are perilous and might bring misfortune and hostile creatures.
- The Watchers, as they are spies and might threat peace.
- The Wars, as they are mercenaries and they pose a threat to peace.


# Prerequisites to Enter

One must prove themselves in physical exams and also in combat.

A rite of passage reciting the moral code of the guild is also needed.

# Facts

They are known for their perfect formation in combat.

Thanks to their connections, they usually have the best armor and weapons avaiable.
