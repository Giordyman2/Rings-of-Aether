# Foundation and Objectives

Founded by the Milinels, the Watchers' Guild has the objective to gather and give informations of any kind. Whether it's political news, commercial secrets or arcane knowledge, the Watchers must know.

# Internal Structure

The guild is structured as a net, with "Nodes" being the center of every information in each city. Each Node is guided by an "Eye" that coordinates the operation within the region.

# Phylosophy

"To know, is to control". 

The access and the diffusion, for a price, of information has the power control anything, whether is war, history and such.

While the Guild generally has the best intentions, not all of them use these informations to better the life of people.

# Prerequisites to Enter

To enter this guild, it's extremely long and hard process.
First off, the new member must be vouched and referred by two existing members. Furthermore he must prove himself in tests and puzzles, while he may also not know that he's being tested.

# Rivals and Allies

The Watchers are in a complicated relationship with the Explorers; while they acknowledge the good from the new discoveries, they usually can get in conflict about the information's rights.
They are in good terms with the Spreekters, who usually buy information from the Watchers.


# Facts

- The Watchers are also well known for their ability in illusion magic.
- The one who stands at the top of the Watchers is unknown and it is said to hold the Infinity Enciclopedia, a very well written and descriptive book about everything ever.
