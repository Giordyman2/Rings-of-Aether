# Foundation and Objectives

Founded by the Lofanians, the Wars' Guild has the objective to give military and mercenary service to anyone who can give them money. Whether it's protection, planned attacks or other military projects, the Wars are ready.


# Internal Structure

The guild is structured like a private military.

At the top we find the Warlord, under him his generals. Every general has several captain and each captain has mercenary squads.


# Phylosophy

"The blade is neutral, the arm isn't".

Their work is just a way to an end, the morality of that end depends on those who pay.

# Rivals and Allies

They do not have allies, however they are usually hired by the Sires to protect their commercial interests. They are rivals to the Defendium, as they are seen as a threat to the status quo.


# Prerequisites to Enter

You must prove yourself in battle and you must vow yourself to the guild. Furthermore you must pay an entrance fee that will be given back only after doing three missions for the guild.


# Facts

- They are known for their extreme brutality and efficacy in battle.
- They have a rigorous honor code, breaking it can get you exiliated from the guild.
