# Foundation and Objectives

Founded by the Draarks, the Craggers' Guild is dedicated to the mastery of craftsmanship in all its forms, from blacksmithing to magical item creation. They are the backbone of technological and magical advancements in the world.

# Internal Structure

The guild is organized into various 'Schools of Craft', each dedicated to a specific form of craftsmanship like blacksmithing, tailoring, or enchanting. Each School is led by a 'Master Artisan', who is considered the epitome of skill in that particular craft. These Master Artisans form the 'Council of Schools', which governs the guild as a whole.

Ranks within each School are:

- Novice
- Apprentice
- Journeyman
- Craftsman
- Master Craftsman (only one per School)

The Council of Schools is responsible for overall guild policies, while each Master Artisan is responsible for their School's curriculum, membership, and internal policies.


# Rivals and Allies

They have a collaborative relationship with the Miggers for agricultural tools and with the Defendium for weapons and armor. However, they find the Greggers overly analytical and lacking in artistic flair.

# Prerequisites to Enter

Aspiring members must present a crafted item of their own making for evaluation. Additionally, they must swear the Oath of Artisanship, vowing to uphold the standards and ethics of their craft.

# Facts

- The guild hosts an annual Craftsmanship Fair, showcasing new inventions and artistic creations.
- Many Craggers are also skilled enchanters, adding magical properties to their crafted items.
