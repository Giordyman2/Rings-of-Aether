This is the center of the world. The last continent.


# The Geography

With the biggest mountain in the world, reaching the Rings itself and [[Floitie\|Floitie]] as well, Drakon's Peak is the most fascinating place in the world. Not only that, but nobody has effectively got even near the peak. The strongest Draark who did, only met an [[Ethereans\|Ethereans]], proving that they actually exist, and fell after that, almost remembering nothing of his life afterwards.

And since [[Draark\|Draark]]s are very religious, they believe that the mountain is itself the manifestation of the Draark's race's heart. At every milestone of the mountain, a temple can be found, at the least at the lower heights.

Some small floating isles were also sighted near the higher heights of the mountain.

But at the foot of the mountain, the Draark live in small villages where they are able to cultivate specific local resources that they use to trade back to Inertia. Furthermore, the unique animals of this continent are rather friendly in the plains at the foot of the mountain. However, predators and stronger creatures can be found as you go up in the mountain.

There is only one big lake that is hidden in the center of the mountains, it is also an hot lake, and in fact, Draarks use it as a way to relax. A lot of visitors of Aaoria just visit the continent to come here.




# Culture and Society

Due to the prideful tendencies of the race, they tend to go along among themselves, but are reluctant to let other races stay in their villages. This was accentuated the moment the villages united under a single great city, named Draakan (not very creative!) and only one Great Leader would decide for the city and who visited them.

They are mostly friendly to anyone who visits, less to who decides to stay for more than one week. They are also successful in trades, most of the common magic items come from here, as Draarks are very good at alchemy, craftmanship ([[Cragger\|Cragger]]s) and magic. This is due to their strict relationship with religious aspects that come down from their profound respect of their ancestors, the dragons.

While The Great Leader decides for everyone, his decisions are usually advised by the Great Seer who is usually an older sage draark.

Much to the Draark's sadness, the [[Defendium\|Defendium]]s are also here, despite the Draarks believing that they do not need help to defend themselves.

It is most interesting that with the adventing of the Defendium, the Cult of The Void approached also here, and a big part of the Draarks were attracted by it and decided to follow it much like they do in [[The States/Cascada\|Cascada]].

A lot of holidays and festivals are in fact shared between their thanks to their ancestors, the dragons, and the void. From the mix of the two, a new deity, called Tiamat, the dragon of all and nothing, was born.

The schools of alchemy and craftmanship are also very important, you can have students from Cascada or [[The States/Faeri\|Faeri]] come all the way here to see new techniques and to learn from them.


When there's an internal conflict, usually The Great Leader is the one that is ultimately left with the final decision, like he was a judge. However, if he's one of the parties who's having a conflict, the generational and cultural rule, affirms that a duel between the Great Leader and the other must happen. Whoever wins, has the right to be right. Furthermore, if the Great Leader loses, he loses his right to be one and a tournament between Draarks, that covers both force, mental and magical challenges, is taken place.


# Legends and Myths

- Tiamat itself was always a legend between the Draark, however when they saw the similitaries between her power and what is the Void, they connected the two, believing that Tiamat is herself The Void.
- It is said that somewhere in the mountains there might be a lone Draark that decided to live alone, or even a small village of lone Draarks.
- Draarks believe in a sword around the world that only the mightest of the Draarks can take.
- When Draarks get their wings for the first time, they must learn how to do so. A ritual is usually taken place for the Draark to fly.
