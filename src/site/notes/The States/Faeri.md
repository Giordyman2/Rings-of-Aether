It's one of the two states of the second inner ring of the world. It used to be one with Caeri, but due to internal war, has now been cut off.

# Geography

What used to be a perfectly balanced territory, much like [[The States/Cascada\|Cascada]], maybe will less water and a more dry temperature, became much less after the continent was split.

## The Corrupted Lands

Due to the violent nature of the split, whom none who was there to witness, dare to say what happen or why it happened, has created a massive corruption to the region near it. Of course, [[Explorers\|Explorers]] have tried to understand why, but both parties, Caerian and Faerian, wanted to forget that it ever happened.

What used to be beautiful plains, turned to red lands with a strange purple smog floating in the air. And while the flora didn't die out, it became mutated and also hostile, becoming a threat to people as well. Cities had to be abandoned, monsters who lived there became magical and stronger and most of the animals either died or mutated into monsters.

Faerians remember this as a scar that was purposely given to them by the Caerians, or so this is what it's shared culturally. Convicted men of especially grave crimes are punished by being left in the middle of these corrupted lands. Some [[Explorers\|Explorers]] use this place to prove to the world their worth.

Or so this was thought, the truth is that there are specific magic minerals, the mithril, a rare magic metal that can only be found in these lands, that can be used to create very powerful magic items and armor.

This has led to the belief that there might be a lot of other treasures hiding in these lands, most of them are tied to what is theorized to have happen, stories that differ from region to region (there are only two region left in Faeri).

This has happened over 200 years ago and has now become an elephant foot in the international exchanges where both Caeri and Faeri representats are present.


## The Green Region

This event was rather unexplainable, and reimain so today. At the same time that the Corrupted Lands were created, on the exact opposite side of the continent, an extremely fertile region on the north was created. It actually became the safest region in the whole world, with almost no monsters, magic curative herbs and friendly animals. 

This was... too good. The animals were able to speak and so were the plants.

They asked to be left alone by the civilization and not to be trifled, as a damage to the world was already been done somewhere else.

The people were not either happy nor sad about this, they were scared. When things go too well, when even nature nurtures people like this, the brain starts to send danger signals, almost like it's not meant to be like this, especially when on the other side of the world a tragedy was being unfold.

This led to the abandonment of this region and the animals and plants taking over the left cities.

Stories of Explorers who visited the now abandoned cities have fond memories of talking to the animals and the plants.

## The Rivers

Unlike Cascada, there's less of an abundance of water, with a nest of rivers that can only be found on the west side of Faeri, mostly coming from the mountains.

And, of course, they have been a huge help to commercial transportation in these lands, but rather than being celebrated as religious and mystical, they have been rationalized as a tool to the means. This is especially due to the fact that every year the courses that these rivers takes change, making it impossible to give a name to them, making it hard to map them and generally not making them a natural source of easy agriculture, forcing cities to create channels and such.


## Mountains and Caves

Mountains and caves can be found all over the continent, but the vast majority of them is found on the east side of the continent, making it possible to create civilization near them, thanks to the abundance of minerals and construction materials.

The biggest mountain, the [[Kriolite\|Kriolite]], is said to have the best sight if reached to the top, or so is what the Explorers believe, because so far, nobody has ever reached the top. This is due to the extreme climate that can be found at those height, the lack of oxygen and an extremely magical force that is forced from the Rings. 

That place is in fact the highest people could get, as not even airships were able to get that near to the Rings due to some strange magical force that would repel objects that got too near them. This, for some reason, was not true for Kriolite.

At the foot of the mountain, a Santuary was built, where people gather to pray or study the Rings and the stars.

The mines have been especially important for various magic gems that were used by the Digirazed to create complex buildings in the cities, thanks to their extremely creative and powerful projection.

While this hasn't been confirmed, it is said that the caves, while extremely perilous once you get farer than what has been already explored, are connected to each other and can make you appear from one region to the other.  

Some of these caves have a turistic value due to their natural bioluminescent beauty and their extraordinary flora and fauna where you can meet what the Draark call "Descendants of Dragons", small lizards that emit lightning.

Caves in south-west have attracted some magical archeology interest due to some catacombs being found in the recent years.


# Society and Culture

## Politics

Despite the regional division, there is still at power a Digirazed oligarchy that takes decisions for both regions. In fact, half of the Council is from one region and the other half from the other, as you would expect. 

However, since the creation of Caeri, the population, especially the [[The Races/Munnen\|Munnen]]s, have tried to get their voice in the Council to take decisions as well.

The Digirazeds, not wanting to do so, are trying to distract the population with turism, religion and the possibility of Caerian attacks.

This political decision has led Colonels to basically migrate to the mountains where they created small villages, which still operate under the laws of the Faerian Council. This has happened mostly in the east, as the west is instead more progressive and even the Council's members that come from the west region have pushed the idea of democracy in the latest years.

Faeri pushed themselves to seek out additional support, which they found in [[Inertia\|Inertia]], who promised that they would defend them if Caeri were to start a conflict. This created a situation where the only commercial partner has become Inertia, while closing off their commercial routes to anyone else. This created a lot of ill thoughts in the population, especially those who were friendly towards other continents, Cascada in particular.


## Cult of the Void

Unlike in Cascada, people tend to not pray nor see with a good eye people who extremely religious, and this is why the Cult of Void here is seen more like a philosophy rather than a religion, where people think and discuss about the nature of the void, the limits of magic and what it means to be and not be. It is generally seen with suspection, but it is tolerated if it's within the academics approach.



## Art and Architecture

Thanks to Digirazed specializing in architecture, a lot of different types of architecture can be seen in their cities, though the west and the east have very different styles. Generally speaking, they go both toward utility, this is why the internal parts of the constructions are usually warm and pleasant to visit and stay.

In fact, twice per year, there's an expo, where all races give birth to new architectural ideas and bring eventual art pieces to decorate the important palaces. This expo is known as the Galant Garant, also known as the GG.


While the Digirazed are more expert in that regards, the few Draark that live there are excellent at music and creating small jewelry; in fact West Faeri's jewelry is famous in the whole world, and so is their new genre of music that utilizes strings made of magic to create a reverb kind of sound that is pleasant to hear.

The Milinels, instead, those who have given up on adventuring due to what has happened during the latest years, have become extremely good cooks, passing down references and recipes from their parents and grandparents who explored the world and encountered many other people, from whom they took the recipes.

So far, to keep the war intent to a minimum, both Faeri's Council and Caeri's Tribal Sages found out that they could keep this intention down by partecipating in sports against each other, sublimating this murderous intent from their respective populations.

Thus the C&F Sports Federation was born around 50 years ago.


## Legends and Myths

- There is a night where all of the stars disappear from the sky. It is said that this is due to a secret Digirazed rite, but nobody has proven that so far. Most believe that any kind of desire you might wish during that night will be fullfilled, at a great cost however.
- The Draarks believe that there rests one of their ancestors on the Kriolite mountain, a white dragon that protects an important treasure that will change the fate of Aoria's Draarks one day.
- There have been stories about ghosts that appear on the nights that the rivers change their ways. 
- Some believe that the animals and plants that are able to talk in the green region are due to souls of dead people possessing them.
- It is a rare belief that the corrupted lands are actually a sigil for an ancient evil and that the war between Faeri and Caeri was just a way to distract people from the true peril.
