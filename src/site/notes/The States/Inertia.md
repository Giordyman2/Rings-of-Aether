It's the second nearest the center continent. It is made of two isles.

# The Geography

Most of the territories are not populated, due to them being perilous and dangerous. In fact, only the west is populated enough, and there is a big tower on the north.

While the territories are fertile and livable, it seems that some magical force has risen the possibility of encountering monsters on the east side of continent.

This is especially true around the Eternal Forest, that is so dense that people tend to get lost in it and never come back. At the center it is said that a sacred oak lives there and it's what gives magic to the world.

The few people that have came back from there, talk about magical friendly beings. Some talk about pegasi, other about friendly chimeras.


While the civilization has made a connection with the two isles through an artificial bridge, in the south there is a chain of mountains, called "The Sky Columns" that connect one land to another. At the foot of them, there are various mines of common minerals.
Many sages and monks use them as meditation spots, but do not go past the bridge.

The artificial one however is the peak of civilization's magic and engineering, made out of light material that emits light during the night and so far has proven to be indestructible. There is an outpost both at the start of the bridge and at the end, since going through it usually takes around 15 minutes of walking.

The tower on the north, called Zenith Tower, is an ambitious project to reach the Rings and analyze them better, however, due to their magical force, this project was never finished, and instead the Tower stopped at the height that is now. Around it, the Woods of The Observer can be found, where few druids and astrologist live.

There are no active records on the unpopulated regions, as most who went there were too damaged, either physically or mentally, to draw a map of what was there.


# Society and Culture

Due to the dangerous territories, the exploration here isn't as romanticized as Cascada or other territories, but is instead seen as a very important job, and the Explorer's Guild tend to be more strict to who can enter them.

Alongside them, the Guardians, a government force that is used to keep peace in the territories near the dangerous ones, help keep the monsters and unseen forces out.

Once again, since Inertia is at hands with the danger, they do not treat religion as superficial as other continents, instead they have a deep druidical cult, especially near the Zenith Tower. 

Same goes for the Cult of The Void, here it's more than a religion and philosophy, for most, it's a deep creed that let people gather their power from; and to be more accepted within the society, they usually donate to the [[Gregger\|Gregger]]s to help build more advanced structures; in fact the Bridge was built entirely on the Cult of The Void's funds.

There are 3 main cities and various villages scattered around that refer to them:

- Cagelian, the main city, the biggest in Inertia, with its big palace for the government. The entire state is run here, through the Druidical Theocracy (which nowadays could be explained as an ecological intellectocracy), which take decisions based off what they learn from the nature and the population itself. Its main focus are the [[Gregger\|Gregger]]s, who are the engineering guild, and the [[Defendium\|Defendium]], an international mercenarial force that is used by each government to keep dangers away. The Guardians are, instead, just Inertian.
- Magellan, the south west city, built near the only river of the continent. Here the [[Watcher\|Watcher]]s (guild that is specialized into information seeking) and the [[Migger\|Migger]]s are the most important professional figures. It is also the most important city for commercial routes.
- Gulon, north-west city, situated after the Bridge, it's mostly a military outpost for the [[Defendium\|Defendium]] and the [[Explorers\|Explorers]].

While the government decided to side with Faeri in case they were attacked, they are still remaining neutral and continue to have commercial routes with Caeri as well. This is not seen well by Faeri's oligarchy.


# Legends and Myths

- It is narrated that the first druid that created the city, named Elowen, "listened" to the land's voice and found out that the land itself wanted a city built upon there. From that moment on, the decisions were mostly done after listening to this voice.
- It is narrated that in Magellan there exists a Watcher that everything knows, but nobody ever saw. It seems he had informations about imminent catastrophies and monster invasions, that were stopped early because he gave the right informations. Some believe it to be a child's story, other believe in its existance.
- It is believed that the Sky Colums are just dead deities bodies that fell in battle and connected the two isles.
