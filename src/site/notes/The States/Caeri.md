Caeri is a state that can be found in the second outer most ring in the world. It is an island that was originally attached to Faeri.

# The Geography

Due to the disaster, most of the lands were now dry and not so fertile anymore, with the climate becoming dry as well, with most of the vegetation near the impact dying and the animals becoming very hostile.

Furthermore the two main resources of this part of the lands, the two mines of extremely important resources, are still there.

There were three leftovers cities from Faeri:

- Jullie, a portual city, on the north, not anywhere near the impact
- Giafranc, which was once an intellectual city of culture
- Eten, a city that was used as an outpost for one of the mines.

These cities became controlled by the [[The Races/Lofanian\|Lofanian]] tribes that lived in the lands and were the ones to start off the war against Faeri.

These tribes are:

- Aelos Tribe, a warrior tribe composed by pure Lofanians
- Belgar Tribe, who are made of Lofanians specialized in metallurgy and craftmanship, alongside some [[The Races/Colonnel\|Colonnel]]s mercenaries
- Caelis Tribe, a tribe made of warriors who are specialized in wizardy and elemental magic, also made by pure Lofanians.
- Drenor Tribe, made of Lofanians and [[The Races/Munnen\|Munnen]]s who are less oriented towards the control of the cities and use the Mystical Agriculture to live in the wasted lands.
- Eryndor Tribe, made of Lofanians and [[The Races/Milinel\|Milinel]]s who are more oriented to exploration and nomadism. They can be very brute and rather than the control of the city, they tend to act as [[The Lore/Fuuder\|Fuuder]]s and attack commercial ships.
- Faelis Tribe, made of pure Lofanians who gained control of the cities through diplomacy. They are especially great in long-distance combat.


# Society and Culture

## Politics

Only one tribe can control a city, and only that tribe can ask tributes to that city.

The Lofanians give the materials to the cities and the cities use those materials to commerce, each tribe saying that they will protect the city from other tribes.

However, this doesn't usually happen, as more tribes ask for tributes from the same city, and asking the population to stay silent, creating a sense of omert√†.

But that doesn't mean that usually there aren't consequences. 

When Faeri and Caeri were split off, the tribes were around 12-10, but they dropped down to 6 after countless wars between them for the supremacy and control of the cities, after this sense of honor which was not respected.

However, none of the cities are passive and take an active approach in fighting the Lofanian tribes.

In Jullie, a group of ex-criminals, who call themselves [[The Redents\|The Redents]], use their power to steal from the Lofanian and give the tributes back to their people.

In Giafranc, sages and old Digirazed hide ancient knowledge and culture of the cities, and might be cooking some magical technology...

In Eten, a group of young people, who call themselves [[The Front Age\|The Front Age]] are trying to use new technologies to better the life of them.

## The Tribes

## Aelos Tribe

As a war tribe, they are very prideful and tend to show it off through duels, war tatoos, aggressive music, which are mostly shown off during the "Day of Valor", where young Lofanians become adults through a series of challenges and adults fight off themselves to figure out who's the strongest and who's fit to lead the tribe.

But it is during the times of peace that the sheer umanitarism of this tribe can be found, as they indulge themselves in narration of their war tales, with creepy and eerie poetry telling about how they smash the enemies skull.


## Belgar Tribe

This tribe is especially religious, and believe that the material they use to forge have been given to them by the gods, and monthly they make a contest to who makes the best weapon. The Collonels enjoy watching the show.

Furthermore, the Lofanians of the Belgar Tribe are especially good cooks who can make the tastiest meal out of the nastiest food.

## Caelis Tribe

Is the biggest tribe, but almost the most controversial one, as there is a different tradition and deity for each elemental magic that you can find here. Most of them are able to concile and talk about the various elements during the cerimonies, especially during the "Dance of the Elements", that they use as a rite to call the elements' spirits.


## Drenor Tribe

They are very good at craftmanship, and are very known globally for their carpets. They are less nomad and tend to create small cities with these ornaments for a period of time, before changing again.


## Eryndor Tribe

They narrate a lot of stories about treasures, about the Rings and about the unknown world. This is usually done after a huge bounty that they got from assaulting commercial routes.


## Faelis Tribe

They are known and even respected by the other tribes to be able to talk to other continents for the commercial trades. All of the other tribes believe that without them, the other tribes wouldn't be able to get the resources to live into the continent through the cities.


# Legends and Myths

- It has been said that a Lofaniel from the Belgar Tribe went down the deepest parts of one of the two mines and never came back. The Tribe believes that he found a special magical metal and was turned back into a creature of pure energy.
- In the Caelis Tribe, there's a legend that says that if the dance is done correctly, a new element can be invoked. However it is also narrated that it was this that created the destruction between Caeri and Faeri, so it has been banned.
- The Eryndor Tribe says that there's a treasure that has been hidden after one of their most successful raid. It is said that it's now guarded by monsters and spirits.
- Before the cataclysm, 200 years ago, there was a fourth city in this region, however it was destroyed. Some believe that there were imporant secrets there. The Digirazed never talked about what went on there.
- The Faelis Tribe believes that the spirits of the desolated lands are what makes them especially great at commerce, thus every year they offer sacrifice to them.
- During the Great Tribe Wars, it is narrated that a single Aelos Tribe warrior once destroyed an entire tribe alone. The gods made him a statue after this carnage, as a sign of his honor, but also his arrogance.
