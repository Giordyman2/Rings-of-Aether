Cascada is a State that can be found in the farthest ring of the world, farthest from the center of the world, and, due to his long circumference, it is also the most populated.

# The Geography

Due to its location, it is both visited regularly due to having an higher welfare, better access to resources that made living better, whether it was from agriculture, thanks to extremely fertile territories, fishes and water from both the sea and rivers and lakes.

This led to a massive civilization that covers all of the territory of the Cascada continent, with little to no wars, thanks to the fact that everyone had the same resources.

In fact, most of the [[The Races/Munnen\|Munnen]] in the world live in this continent, since they are mostly protected here, and while the cities present a varified demography, Munnens are the regularity here.

The [[The Lore/Falls of Destiny\|Falls of Destiny]] were also very important, both culturally and for the growth of the civilization.

Thanks to the complex net of rivers that go into most of the lakes of the continent, it is possible to navigate through the continent completely on boat, this has permitted a fast travel of resources between the various territories, which has also led to more peace.

Furthermore, there are few lakes, the biggest one included, who are known to have healing and magic herbs.

- The Serequill Lake is known for its flora that grows only during the night, under the moon.
- The Thymbrae Lake is known for its herb "Eternea", which is rumored to have been an ingredient to longer life for the [[The Races/Colonnel\|Colonnel]]s.
- The Miralis Lake, which are famous for the Dream Flowers, that are herbs that can create hallucinations and meditative states when infused.
- The Seraphel Lake, which is known for the "Spirit of the Lake", a legend that says that a spirit lies in that lake and can be summoned in times of need. It is also the biggest lake in Cascada.

The two most important rivers, the first one is the one that goes through all of Cascada, it's called Aetheris River, which is venerated almost as a deity of fertilty. The other one is the River Of Time, which is said that has a specific current of water that goes straight to the [[The Lore/Falls of Destiny\|Falls of Destiny]] and has properties that slow down the perception of time.



# Society and Culture

### Agriculture

Agriculture has been always the most important product for both the economy and the well being of Cascada, this due to the geographic position. Furthermore, over the years, a specific way of making crops was invented, involving magic. This was discovered by the [[The Races/Digirazed\|Digirazed]], creating two arts, the [[Botania\|Botania]] and the [[Mystical Agriculture\|Mystical Agriculture]], the first one focusing on the magical power that can be drawn from specific herbs and flowers, the second one being an infusion of magical power inside the seeds planted.

The cycles are very fast and the crops tend to grow faster than the inner continents as well, and this is particularly true in the [[River Valley\|River Valley]], a valley where a lot of rivers encounter in Seraphel Lake, while some magical crops tend to grow only in the Heights.

While agriculture has been dominant, fishing and seafaring has become very important lately and agriculture has been losing its foot, this is why alchemy and medicine are being advanced as well, so agriculture won't lose its first place.

This is especially true thanks to the Feast Festival, the most important holiday in all Cascada, which is also the day of reaping the seeds that were sown. It is a day where people make their wishes for what they want to change, planting their own "personality seeds" so they could reap what they sow and grow into better people.

Since agriculture is deemed so high, there is a rite of passage before becoming an [[The Lore/Migger\|Migger]], as the land is deemed sacred and only the fit can effectively touch it. This rite is called Vow of the Sower.


### Mysticism and Religion

As I mentioned, two important way of magic here are [[Botania\|Botania]] and [[Mystical Agriculture\|Mystical Agriculture]].

However, the beliefs are very varied here.

You can find the [[Water Sciamanism\|Water Sciamanism]], a friendly cult that believes in the heart and will of the water flows in the continent, to be a member of it you need to have the power to manipulare or invoke the water energy. The members are usually [[The Races/Milinel\|Milinel]]s that travel to dry places to give them life with water.

You may also find the [[Cult of Natural Spirits\|Cult of Natural Spirits]], who seek guidance and protection to the spirits of the nature, specifically the ones that come from important places, like Seraphel Lake. Unlike the Water Sciamanism, which is a way of life and philosophy, this cult is more of a creed or religion. There is also this very famous legend that in Cascada there might be a fantastic garden, Gardia Aeterna, which is guarded by a spirit and only who's worthy can get it.

Much like in the other continents, there can be found science people that try to read the moviments of [[The Lore/The Rings\|The Rings]] in the sky to predict the future and help the local governants. They gather power from the stars above the rings to do so, as Astrologists, and then either put it in their body or magic items.

The most influent cult that you may find in Cascada, and generally in the world, is the [[Void Cult\|Void Cult]], which believes that everything comes from it and everything returns to it. It's all a cycle. The Rings are what represent this cycle. 

Since it's a very vast religion, it has been interpreted very differently;
the first one to talk about this was [[Kukuluth\|Kukuluth]], as he spreaded a way to not suffer and not care about the unknown of the world, to live instead in the moment and with the others. And in Cascada, that's what the cult believes, in fact the Void Oracles are people who have a lot of political local linfluence and tend to create mass of people with whom they share the Void Meditation.


### Exploration

There's a rather active Explorer's Guild, who invites most people to explore all the territories that have been overlooked. While Cascada has been mostly civilized, the Lands In-Between are still not completely safe and there are regions in the map that have not been finished yet nor explored, and this is in spite of almost thousand of years of existance. 

Cascada's Explorer's Guild has had a very proactive approach towards the other continents, believing that they could help other guilds as well, due too to their antropologic curiosity for the [[The Races/Draark\|Draark]] and [[The Races/Lofanian\|Lofanian]], that rarely show up in Cascada.

There has been a subculture of the Explorer's Guild, which is mostly made by Magic Archeologists, who seek old structures, places and cities thanks to their magical power and the magic contained within such places.

Furthermore, the [[Explorer's Guild\|Explorer's Guild]] has funded the creation of the airships, which have been used so far only to try to go over the Falls of Destiny, failing miserably.


### Politics

Due to the enourmous territorial space governed by Cascada, it was agreed since the very beginning that a central government would have failed miserably. The sage [[Julian\|Julian]] who has been alive for more than 500 years still remembers the words of his father that narrated how the territories were split.

It started as a game between 6 people, to see who could explore more.

From there, the continent was divided in Regions and State-Cities;

the Regions would be subsequentially divided into provinces:

- [[Alcada\|Alcada]], with its 8 provinces in the north
- [[Lacunia\|Lacunia]], with its 7 provinces in the south
- [[Hilia\|Hilia]], with its 9 provinces in the south east

Each province is governed by a local lord, who refers to the Lord Committee at the Region, where a representative would be chosen to go to the [[Council of The Six\|Council of The Six]] and discuss their problems and/or news with the other Regions.

State-Cities are different, as they have a more centralized power, where as a single King states his rules over a big territory. There are few State-Cities, them being:

- [[Inter\|Inter]], State-City mother of culture, where most of the magic user and scholars meet. It has the biggest university in the world and each year it has a festival to show off new inventions and discoveries. It is placed in the south-west.
- [[Sia\|Sia]], portual State-City, situated near the Seraphel Lake, making it thus the best way of communicating with other cities. It is located in the west.
- [[Balpro\|Balpro]], religious State-City, where people come to greet the Mist and pray to the Falls. It is located in the north-west.

While historically there have been almost zero conflicts between the regions, there have been play of power to get into the Council of The Six between the insides of the Regions.


As for external relationships outside Cascada, there are Munnen Ambassadors that come from Inter and Alcada that smooth out things, such as commerce, economics, military issues with the other continents.

And while Inter is a cultural center, they are rather conservative about their scholar, as they tend to gather and rarely to let go of them.


### Legends and Myths

- It is said that Inter was founded by a Colonel named "Eldren" who searched knowledge throughout the world. Finding out that not all the truths come when are looked for, he decided to create a city where all people who seek knowledge could meet. He was one of the original six explorers.
- It is said that Lyrna, a famous archer, stopped a monster invasion to Hilia with only one arrow, that was guided by magic and killed most of the monsters in one swoop.
- The Feast Festival was inspired by the God of Fertility who once blessed Cascada's territories with bontiful harvest during a famine. From then on, the festival has become a way to thanks the gods and make amends for the rest of the year.
- An ancient farmer, known as "Semir," once made a solemn vow that if his crops survived a drought season, he would devote his life to teaching others the arts of agriculture. His crops miraculously survived, and the Sower's Vow has since become a rite of passage for future [[The Lore/Migger\|Migger]]s.
- It is said that the waters around Sia have an hidden secret, a portal to another world or a place where time is frozen. This is because sometimes ships disappear and then tend to reappear years later, without the sailors getting older. However, it is thought that this is just a legend to cover [[The Lore/Fuuder\|Fuuder]]s activities.
- In Balpro, some said that during some nights it is possible to visit an invisible tower. Nobody knows what the tower contains nor why it appears, and nobody has ever got into it, either.
