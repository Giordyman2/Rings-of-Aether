Cascada is a State that can be found in the farthest ring of the world, farthest from the center of the world, and, due to his long circumference, it is also the most populated.

# The Geography

Due to its location, it is both visited regularly due to having an higher welfare, better access to resources that made living better, whether it was from agriculture, thanks to extremely fertile territories, fishes and water from both the sea and rivers and lakes.

This led to a massive civilization that covers all of the territory of the Cascada continent, with little to no wars, thanks to the fact that everyone had the same resources.

In fact, most of the [[The Races/Munnen\|Munnen]] in the world live in this continent, since they are mostly protected here, and while the cities present a varified demography, Munnens are the regularity here.

The [[The Lore/Falls of Destiny\|Falls of Destiny]] were also very important, both culturally and for the growth of the civilization.

Thanks to the complex net of rivers that go into most of the lakes of the continent, it is possible to navigate through the continent completely on boat, this has permitted a fast travel of resources between the various territories, which has also led to more peace.

Furthermore, there are few lakes, the biggest one included, who are known to have healing and magic herbs.

- The Serequill Lake is known for its flora that grows only during the night, under the moon.
- The Thymbrae Lake is known for its herb "Eternea", which is rumored to have been an ingredient to longer life for the [[Colonnel\|Colonnel]]s.
- The Miralis Lake, which are famous for the Dream Flowers, that are herbs that can create hallucinations and meditative states when infused.
- The Seraphel Lake, which is known for the "Spirit of the Lake", a legend that says that a spirit lies in that lake and can be summoned in times of need. It is also the biggest lake in Cascada.

The two most important rivers, the first one is the one that goes through all of Cascada, it's called Aetheris River, which is venerated almost as a deity of fertilty. The other one is the River Of Time, which is said that has a specific current of water that goes straight to the [[The Lore/Falls of Destiny\|Falls of Destiny]] and has properties that slow down the perception of time.



# Society and Culture

### Agriculture

Agriculture has been always the most important product for both the economy and the well being of Cascada, this due to the geographic position. Furthermore, over the years, a specific way of making crops was invented, involving magic. This was discovered by the [[Digirazed\|Digirazed]], creating two arts, the [[Botania\|Botania]] and the [[Mystical Agriculture\|Mystical Agriculture]], the first one focusing on the magical power that can be drawn from specific herbs and flowers, the second one being an infusion of magical power inside the seeds planted.

The cycles are very fast and the crops tend to grow faster than the inner continents as well, and this is particularly true in the [[River Valley\|River Valley]], a valley where a lot of rivers encounter in Seraphel Lake, while some magical crops tend to grow only in the Heights.

While agriculture has been dominant, fishing and seafaring has become very important lately and agriculture has been losing its foot, this is why alchemy and medicine are being advanced as well, so agriculture won't lose its first place.

This is especially true thanks to the Feast Festival, the most important holiday in all Cascada, which is also the day of reaping the seeds that were sown. It is a day where people make their wishes for what they want to change, planting their own "personality seeds" so they could reap what they sow and grow into better people.

Since agriculture is deemed so high, there is a rite of passage before becoming an [[Migger\|Migger]], as the land is deemed sacred and only the fit can effectively touch it. This rite is called Vow of the Sower.
