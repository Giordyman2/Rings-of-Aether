# Foundation and Objectives

Founded by the Munnens, the Spreekters have the objective to perfect the art of convincing, rethoric and eloquital discourse.

The Munnens being known for their charismatic abilities, the guild is used as a Formation Center for the best orators, negotiatiors and diplomats.


# Internal Structure

One single man is at the top of the Guild, the person who is able to convince even the highest ranks of the guild that he is simply the best at talking. 
That rank is known as "The Orator" itself, a word that isn't used lightly when someone tries to refer to themselves as one. In fact, if someone refer to themselves as an orator, they always usually point out that they mean the non-capitalized one. The Orator usually takes decisions for the whole guild; in his absence Counsellors do, etc.

Other ranks are apprentice, orator (non capitalized), Word Master and Counsellor. 


# Phylosophy 

"Words are stronger than swords" is their motto.

They truly believe that they could convince anyone not to take arms, to create alliances and to influence the story.


# Rivals and Allies

They are in good terms with the Sires, as they usually pay the guild to lower the prices for trades.

They do have a storical rivality with the Gazers, berating their theories about the world and "not seeing what really is important" and "trying to find meaning where there isn't one".


# Prerequisites to Enter

To enter, a candidate must simply convince the interviewer to enter the guild. If they succeed, they are in.
