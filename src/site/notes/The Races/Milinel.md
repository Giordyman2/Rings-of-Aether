Milinels are a race that is physiologically made of very small people, around 50 to maximum 110 centimenters. Thanks to their small build, they have been always smart explorers.

This has also made their curiosity basically a biological need, to know about the world and to interact with the unknown.

Those who do not explore or those who have retired, tend to write books about their adventures or what they would have wanted to to as adventurers, some become bard and narrate these adventures with music.

Generally, Milinels are always cheerful and are probably the most friendly race of the planet. Most believe that their cheerfulness might be therapeutic.
