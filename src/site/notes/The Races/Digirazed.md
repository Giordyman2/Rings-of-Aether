Digirazeds are a race that is made out of a floating brain and their respective nervous systems. Not having a physical body in the traditional sense, they are very exposed and tend to rely on their psyonic and magical power.

In fact, they have become very good at manipulating mind powers, so much that they are able to convey mental images very well. This is why they are very good architects, as they are able to convey complex structures with ease.

They also communicate through telepathy and move things around using telekinesis.

A lot of Digirazed tend to not be religious, however some are attracted by the phylosophy of the Cult of The Void, as the Digirazed question their own origins and their own adaptility to the harsh world they live in.

They are able to reproduce only when 4 or more Digirazed focus on one point to create a similar being. Digirazed tend to live forever, however most of them go crazy once they live for more than 200 years, making them vulnerable. 
But their process of mating is very hard, since 4 or more Digirazed must be on the same wavelenght and imagine the same being. This has led to a slow fall of their demographic.
