Colonnels are a race that physiologically is very big, around 3 to 4 meters of height, with massive biological builds.

Colonnels, being one of the races that gets to live the most, tend to develop a critical and deep thought about the world and who lives in it.

In fact, most of them are phylosophers and thinkers, whereas the small communities where they live, inside the cities, are made of long and talked discussions when one decision must be taken.
