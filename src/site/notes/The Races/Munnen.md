# Origins

Munnen are a cross-breed of [[Milinel\|Milinel]]s and [[Colonnel\|Colonnel]]s, resulting in this weird middle ground between the two, with no tactical small height, nor slowed aging, nor huge build to scare off predators. Thus Munnens found themselves in an harsh world with no special traits that could be used to adapt to it.

However, this is why Munnens became the orators that they are nowadays. 

They had to protect themselves somehow, but being unable to do it themselves, they developed a good way of communicating with other races and species, taming them or by simplying convincing them to protect them, Munnens managed to survive and being the most expanded race, thanks to their extreme breedability.
