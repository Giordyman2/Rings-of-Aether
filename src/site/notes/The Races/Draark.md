Standing at an average height between 1.8 to 2.2 meters, Draarks are an imposing race with dragon-like features, including scales, elongated snouts, and, for some, even wings (take a look at [[The States/Aaoria\|Aaoria]]'s Draarks). These humanoid dragons are deeply religious, viewing themselves as descendants or even chosen ones of ancient dragons. This belief forms the cornerstone of their culture and laws.

Like the Lofanians, Draarks place a high value on pride and honor, but these traits are further amplified by their spiritual convictions. To a Draark, one's honor is not just a personal or family matter; it's a sacred duty. This makes them fiercely loyal to their communities and unyielding in their beliefs.

While many Draarks are trained in the arts of war, due to their natural build and abilities, they also have a strong affinity for magicâ€”especially elemental magic that resonates with the draconic lineage. Many are skilled alchemists, as they believe that the mastery of elements is a form of devotion to their dragon ancestors.

Their strong sense of community and spirituality also leads them to create intricate temples and shrines dedicated to dragon deities, where they perform elaborate rituals and ceremonies. It's not uncommon for Draarks to go on pilgrimages to places believed to be touched by ancient dragons.

Though they can be very welcoming and gracious hosts, Draarks have stringent codes of conduct and social norms that they expect everyone within their domain to adhere to. Failure to do so is not just an insult to the individual Draark but is considered an affront to their entire lineage and, by extension, their draconic gods.
