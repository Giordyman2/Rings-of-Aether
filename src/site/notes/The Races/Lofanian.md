The Lofanians are a humanoid with a lion face and paws race that is well built and is usually between the 1.75 and 2 meters long.

While Lofanians' culture may change from place to place (take a look at [[The States/Caeri\|Caeri]]'s tribes), some traits are shared.

For example, Lofanians are very prideful and honorful, both in war and in peace. This means that they do put their community above everything else.
And while they are very good at battle, they have shown extremely good craftmanship, second only to Draarks, and herborists. In fact, they use this knowledge to live even in the worst parts of the continents, thanks to their survivalist build as well.

Even in civilized cities, they tend to be nomad and to change homes every year.

Furthermore they are very good at handling animals and are strong part of the [[The Lore/Defendium\|Defendium]].
